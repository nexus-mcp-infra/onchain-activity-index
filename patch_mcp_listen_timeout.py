patch_mcp_listen_timeout.py

Standalone patch for onchain-activity-index/main.py.

ROOT CAUSE (same pattern already confirmed and fixed on erc8004-agent-liveness
2026-09-03, see that repo's patch_mcp_listen_timeout.py for the full
root-cause writeup; confirmed here via Cloud Logging export the same day):
third-party "agent trust"/MCP-monitoring bots issue a GET to /mcp/, which
the official MCP Python SDK's Streamable HTTP transport treats as opening a
server-to-client SSE "listen" stream for server-initiated push
notifications. This asset never sends any (it's a plain request/response
tool), and the code never closes an idle listen connection on its own -- so
every bot that opens one rides Cloud Run's outer 300s request timeout
before being cut off, and Cloud Run bills the full held-open duration as
active instance time. Evidence for this asset: 428 requests, GET /mcp/,
status 200, latency clustered at ~301s.

FIX: a narrow ASGI middleware that applies a short server-side timeout
(default 25s) ONLY to GET requests whose path starts with /mcp. Every
other path (including the paid POST tool-call path and the x402 payment
flow) is untouched. A real MCP client that needs to keep listening simply
reconnects -- cheap -- instead of holding a phantom connection open for
five minutes -- expensive. Lossless for this asset specifically because it
has no server-initiated notifications today.

Usage:
    python patch_mcp_listen_timeout.py [path/to/main.py]

Defaults to ./main.py if no path given.
